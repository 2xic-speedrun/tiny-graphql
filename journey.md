## GraphQL implementation

## Day 1.
Just setting things up. Wrote a basic parser that can parse a query schema. 

Tomorrow I will finish the parser, and clean up the code used for the parsing. 

## Day 2
Plan : More or less complete the parser. Missing features are for instance
- Validation of types (string, int, date)
- field alias
- mutation
- schema does not need to have query specified, or name.
- input variables for schema ($variables)
-
